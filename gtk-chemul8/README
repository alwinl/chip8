GtkMM_project
=============

This custom project has the following features:
Build targets for Debug, Release, Test, Windows32 and Windows64


Uncompress the windows dll's by issuing the following command in the root directory of the project:

For Windows targets, build the target first.
Next uncompress the windows dll's by issuing the following command in the root directory of the project:
	tar -xf win??.tar.gz -C bin where ?? is either 32 or 64

Now the target is ready to be run

Note. Instead of uncompressing the windows dlls, install the GTK runtime on the target machine.

Maendeleo has the GTK runtime already installed.
